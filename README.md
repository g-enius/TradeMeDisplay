# TradeMeDisplay

A native iOS App can display the Trade Me Categories and the first 20 listings in each one.
All API calls are from their Sandbox environment.

It supports both iPhone and iPad, besides iPad users can view the category and its listings simultaneously. 

It also supoorts instant search and displays search results and detialed page of one result at the same time.

There is also a small issue about contentInset of tableView with a searchBar as its tableViewHeader, which is certainly a iOS system bug. Please see the snapshop of Setting App on iOS 10.2.1 (14D27) iPhone 6s Plus.
